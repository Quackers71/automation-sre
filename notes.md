# IT Automation

- 18:48 - If (time_to_automate * task_frequency) (time_to_perform * task_frequency), then automate the task!
- Keep in mind that once a task is wrapped in automation anyone can do it.
- Pareto principle - 20% of the system administration tasks you perform are responsible for 80% of your work.
- Bit Rot - The actual bits in the script don't decay, but its assumptions about the implicit signals it relies on do.
- Create a notification method that could be anything from an email to an update on a a dashboard.  It surfaces the error so a person can actually fix the automation.
